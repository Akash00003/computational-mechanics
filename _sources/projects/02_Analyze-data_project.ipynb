    "On the first day of class, we threw $2\"\\times~2\"$ dampened paper (spitballs) at a target on the whiteboard. Now, we are going to analyze the accuracy of the class with some cool Python tools and design a robot that has the same accuracy and precision as the class, but we will have the robot move farther away from the target and use a simpler projectile i.e. a tennis ball so we don't need to worry about knuckle-ball physics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to determine the precision of necessary components for a robot that can reproduce the class throwing distibution. We have generated pseudo random numbers using `numpy.random`, but the class target practice is an example of truly random distributions. If we repeated the exercise, there is a vanishingly small probability that we would hit the same points on the target, and there are no deterministic models that could take into account all of the factors that affected each hit on the board. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The first question, we have some experience from our work in [02_Seeing_Stats](../notebooks/02_Seeing_Stats.ipynb). We can define the mean, standard deviation, measure the first, second, and third quartiles,  etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second question is a physical question. We cannot control the placement of the robot or the target those are chosen for us. We cannot control temperature, mechanical vibrations, etc. We *can* control the desired initial velocity. The initial velocity will have some speed and direction, and both will be subject to random noise. Once the speed and direction are set, the location on the target is determined by kinematic equations for an object in freefall, as such\n",

    "The third question, is how we can relate equation (2) to the measured points of impact? For this, we can use Monte Carlo methods *(There are other methods, but Monte Carlo is one of the most straight-forward)*. Our Monte Carlo approach is as such, if we have a desired initial speed, $v_0$, and desired angle, $\\theta$, we can propagate the uncertainty of our actual speeds and angles into the $z_{impact}$ locations. Then, we can choose distributions in speed and angles that match the distributions in $z_{impact}$ locations. Here are the steps:\n",
