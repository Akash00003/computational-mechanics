4. Now that we have a working numerical model, we can look at the results if the
ambient temperature is not constant i.e. T_a=f(t). We can use the weather to improve our estimate for time of death. Consider the following Temperature for the day in question. 

    |time| Temp ($^o$F)|
    |---|---|
    |6am|50|
    |7am|51|
    |8am|55|
    |9am|60|
    |10am|65|
    |11am|70|
    |noon|75|
    |1pm|80|

    a. Create a function that returns the current temperature based upon the time (0 hours=11am, 65$^{o}$F) 
    *Plot the function $T_a$ vs time. Does it look correct? Is there a better way to get $T_a(t)$?

    b. Modify the Euler approximation solution to account for changes in temperature at each hour. 
    Compare the new nonlinear Euler approximation to the linear analytical model. 
    At what time was the corpse 98.6$^{o}$F? i.e. what was the time of death?
